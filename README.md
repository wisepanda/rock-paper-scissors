## Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Project started on week one of School of Code and the bootcamp's first hackaton.

This was the first time I applied computational thinking, created code from scratch and got stuck and asked for help.

The project was left unfinished even though I was working on it at times and I remember being amazed by the amount of logic needed for a "simple" rock, paper, scissors game!

Unfortunately, for how the game is structured on alerts, prompts and loops, I wasn't able to deploy the page even though being fully functional;
so I have decided I will refactor the code and build the game with React insted. But that will take some time.

If you'd like to have a play:
 - clone the repository
 - rund index.html with liveserver
 - Enjoy the game!

I feel this project is important because it's growing and evolving with me every step of the way and it will get better and better!
